<p>One slow, careful step. The gravel crunches beneath my feet <i>The Rock</i>, they call it. Rugged, untamed, just a little bit wild. Thirty years since I'd been to this place I once called home. I'd been young and a little wild myself. Roaming the marshes until I couldn't see the village houses. Tempting the tides, wind ripping through my hair, climbing the jagged ledges at the last moment, with sure feet and strong hands. That was before. Before sadness settled around me and my life changed forever.</p>

<p>This day, many years later, my daughter walks beside me. My hand wraps around her arm. Another tentative step. Testing the ground. Testing my strength. Leaning heavily on my cane, a little out of breath. Heart pounding, world darkening. I tighten my grip. On my cane. On my daughter's arm. She stops, knowing. Not a word, but a patient understanding. After all this time, I know she has me. We look at each other, then towards the cemetery. People are gathering. My brother stands off to the side, cradling the urn that contains the ashes of our father. He'd died months earlier, but we'd made this journey now in order to reunite our father and mother. It's what they would of wanted. It's what we had to do.</p>

<p> A moment passes. My daughter looks at me calmly. "Ready?"" she asks.  

<p>I nod.</p>

<p>As we walk, the gravel shifts. The ground dips in places, but my daughter, and my cane, stead me. Part of me, moving as one. Practiced.</p> 

<p>As we make it to the grave, a woman reaches out. I don't recognize her, but she wraps her arms around me. Familiar. Comforting. I remember. Time had changed her, but her hugs were just the same. She'd taken me in, and treated me like one of her own, <i>after</i>, when no one else seemed to know what to do with a sullen, and suddenly rather destructive, twelve year old.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you are here," I say.</p> 

<p>She steps back and looks at me with warmth in her eyes. Her eyes linger a moment too long on my cane. Uncertainty crosses her face, then she leans in, gestured at my cane and asked in hushed voice, "Are you crippled?"</p> 

<p>Crippled.</p> 

<p>Unfiltered. Raw. In that moment, I think of my mother. The days when she couldn't get out of bed. The hospital visits. The canes and the wheelchairs.  Dead at fifty-five. <i> Crippled.</i> Is that what they called her behind closed doors? Or maybe to her face? We never talked about it. I didn't know the struggles she faced or how she made sense of her disability. I was just a kid. What I did know, however, was that we didn't <i>ever</i> call her crippled. Even then, the word sounded dirty, like, "You don't want to be around them. They're crippled," or tragic, like, "Oh, the poor dear, she's crippled."</p>

<p>However, there, in the cemetery, surrounded by history, I recognized another there was another way.</p> 

<p>"Yes, I'm crippled." I replied.</p>
