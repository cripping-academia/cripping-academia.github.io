<p>I write from a soft place. A nest, in my bed. Surrounded by pillows, dogs by my side. Window open. Sunlight and fresh air streaming in. This bed is not a refuge, a quiet place to escape. It's a prerequisite. From this bed I live my life as my body so often dictates&mdash; sometimes quietly suggesting, most often insisting without warning. At first, this felt like defeat. At times it still does, but from this bed I've learned that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/the-nap-bishop-explains-why-rest-is-a-form-of-radical-resistance-1.6797668" target=_blank>rest is resistance</a>. Sometimes rest is survival and, for bodies like mine, that is deeply political. From this bed, in my own time, I've worked to (nearly) completed a degree in social work. This journey has been one that has shaped by refusal&mdash; a concept once foreign to me. The refusal to push through pain and exhaustion in order to be productive and keep up with the hustle of academic life. The refusal to give up, despite a system that wasn't built for bodies (or minds) like mine. The refusal to believe that there aren't other ways to exist, to show up, and to learn. 

<p> When I started this post, my intention was to say that <i>Cripping Academia</i> comes from a soft place, not only bause I am writing from bed, but because I am writing from a place of vulnerability, sharing parts of myself in ways that I haven't before. However, in that vulnerabilty is also strength&mdash; the strength to ask for what I need from an institution that wants easy. The strength, and willingness, to allow myself to begin imagine a world where our university experiences are shaped by collective care and not institutional pressure, and erasure. So, no, <i>Cripping Academia</i> might be written from a soft place, but it comes also from a place of resilience. 

<p>I am writing this blog as part of a "non-traditional/non-agency" practicum as my final requirement to graduate, though it means so much more to me than that. My hope is that this blog will be a plac where I can explore:

	<ul>
        <li>how academia affects the stories that disabled folks tell about themselves </li>
        <li>how White supremacy and Western ideologies show up in academia and results in institutions that are inherently disabling</li>
        <li>how disability justice helps us reimagine what access looks like</li>
        <li>ways to confront my own personal internalized ableism</li>
        <li>the ways in which disabled communities are already caring for one another.</li>
        <li> and more (everything is pretty fluid, so I'm not sure what you might find.)

    </ul>
	
	My hope is that this practicum project, be it through <i>Cripping Academia</i> or another project yet to be imagined, will bring together other disabled students, alumni and scholars to share our experiences, ideas and resources and, most of all, to cultivate an environment collective care. As I was envisioning this practicum the words of Mia Mingus resonated deeply within me

	<blockquote>When I say "liberatory access," I mean access that is more than simply having a ramp or being scent free or providing captions. Access for the sake of access or inclusion is not necessarily liberatory, but access done in the service of love, justice, connection and community is liberatory and has the power to transform. &mdash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm21KpsNk1s" target=_blank>Mia Mingus</a> (October, 13th, 2018)
</blockquote> 

<p>It was clear to me as I was designing this practicum experience that I was not interested in creating a project where I was exploring the (in)accessibility of academia for disabled folks in order to offer the university solutions&mdash; I'm not sure they want to change. I was interested in something different&mdash;a way for disabled folks to come together to connect and support each other, all while imagining, and creating, a world in which disabled voices are centred in academia and not made invisible.</p>
